                    Evangeline Lilly, born in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, in 1979, was 
                    discovered on the streets of Kelowna, British Columbia, by the famous 
                    Ford modeling agency. Although she initially decided to pass on a 
                    modeling career, she went ahead and signed with Ford anyway, to help 
                    pay for her University of British Columbia tuition and expenses.
