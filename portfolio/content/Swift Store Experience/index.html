                Goal
            </h1>
            <p>
                During the sale moments we all are being confronted with the enormous chaos in several stores.
                Especially
                cloth stores suffer from the more or the less unsociable behaviour of several customers. They drop their
                cloth were they don't belong and use the fitting room a way too long.
            </p>
            <p>
                These frustration causes a shift to online shopping which already was a growing problem for many
                physical cloting stores.
                Sadly, this process enforces some already substantial problems.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Less real world social interaction between the customers and the sales staff.
                </li>
                <li>
                    More transportation of not fitting cloths which is bad for the environment.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Shoppings becomes less satisfactory due the lack of physical proof of you shopping effort.

                Pick up an scanner and scan your cloth
            </h1>
            <p>
                The first step in the user flow is picking up a scanner as you do in some modern supermarkets. These are
                situated
                at the entrance of the tore.
            </p>
            <p>
                After you have picked up a scanner you start selecting the items you want to try. Of all cloth pieces
                there's
                just one size. This makes it easier for the store staff to clear the room.

                Try out the selected cloth and buy them
            </h1>
            <p>
                After you have selected a some cloth you liked you can try them out in one of the new fitting rooms.
                After you've entered
                the fitting room you can place your scanner in a holder. As soon as you do this some infrared scanners
                will scan your body.
            </p>
            <p>
                When your body proportion are scanned you can project the earlier selected cloth on your body. The
                software of the fitting room
                will automatically select the right size if available. You can trie out all the combinations you want.
                The cloth you don't like can be removed.
            </p>
            <p>
                After you've tried out the selected goods inside the fitting room you can go to the cash desk. The store
                staff will read out your
                scanner and provide you with the cloths in the right size.
