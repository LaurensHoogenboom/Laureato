                Future of the City
            </h1>
            <p>
                In what way will our cities change in the coming 30 years? Would they be cleaner, more sustainable and livable?
                Or will they be plageued by new diseases, be more stressfull to live in and more poluted then ever? The
                outcome would probably be something in the middle of these scenarios. And each outcome will have it's pro's and con's.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the most best ways to explore an scenario is to take part of that scenario. Creating a game is probably one
                of the most immersive ways. Therefore we created a game which speculates on the future of Bogota, Colombia.

                            The slums cause problems during the development of the new city model. Therefore it is decided to enforce
                            investments and regulation. Govermental organizations start with buying giant pieces of land and assign these
                            to the project which fullfill the requirements of the new city model. The slums will be replaced by cheap homes 
                            affordable for the old slum dwellers through govermental grants.
