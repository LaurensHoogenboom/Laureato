            <p>
                We captures the most important moments of our lives in pictures very often. These remember us 
                to the ambiance, love and feeling of that moment. This great way of documenting has one big problem, though.
                Those who are blind can not see these pictures. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We aimed to resolve this problem by developing a device that makes picutres and screens visible. Although our
                prototypes was not perfect it proofed that the experience was nearly magical. Real blind persons did get a sense
                of what was visible in the test pictures.

                Sketching our prototype
            </h1>
            <p>
                The first step of designing our protype was simply sketching our visions. Decisions about the placement of
                sensors, vibrationmotors and cirquits were made. The first decisions are the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The vibrations motors are placed at the finger tips. In that way the user will get the most immersive experience.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sensors for color and brightness will be placed beneed the fibration motor. This will ensure a good oriÃ«ntation of the user.

                Choosing technologies
            </h1>
            <p>
                We decided to use an Arduino UNO module as basement for our prototype. It provides a powerfull an easy to use platform for the development of hardware.
                As soon as we made this decision we started to code our product. The following materials were used:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Arduino UNO, including transistors and wires
                </li>
                <li>
                    Adafruit Vibrating Mini Motor Disc
                </li>
                <li>
                    Adafruit Photo cell (CdS photoresistor)

                First test
            </h1>
            <p>
                We were eager to test our prototype as soon as we had our base code ready. Were where happy that it worked as expected.
                The video show you the responsive of the vibration motor at different light intensity levels. After the we indentified
                the following points of improvement:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The light sensort had to be focused at one single point to improve presision.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We needed a callibration mechanism to adjust the device for different lighting situations.

                Making it usable
            </h1>
            <p>
                After we fineshed the technical development of the prototype we focussed on the usability of the device.
                In what way would the user wear the device? What materials do we need and how are we going to produce it?
                At the end we decided the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    We were going to use velcro tape and elastics as main materials
                </li>
                <li>
                    The device is going to be worn around to top of the finger
                </li>
                <li>
                    A cable is used to transfer the data to and from the Arduino 
                </li>
            </ul>

            </h1>
            <p>
                The final product was usable and capable of fullfilling the needs of the potential user. As always there
                are some points of improvement:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    In a ideal situation the device has to be wireless. It should have a battery, led indicator and cirquit build in.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To make the device usable on more complex pictures it needs a more precise sensor.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The indentify difference in subtle difference in color and brightness the device needs a more sophisticated feedback system.
                </li>
