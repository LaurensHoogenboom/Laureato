                    This is a drawing of several defining elements of "The West" during the early period of the Union.
                    For me, this painting was mainly a study of light and texture in still lives. It took 3 months to finish, over a 100 drawing hours.

                    This painting is based on a greater example of <a href="http://kylepolzin.com/">Kyle Polzin</a>.
